hello world project
A little about self:

My name is James Simoneau

I'm a newbie of programming but i've used computers my whole life on and off.
I'd like to learn how to use python for web dev or backend django to start hosting a website. 
I'm currently working on setting up a raspberry pi 4, running rasbarian lite Os headless , trying out LeMP style nginx server for some static web hosting for learning practice.

Here's to the end of the readme ! Thanks for reading would love any input or help.
